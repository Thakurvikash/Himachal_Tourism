<p>Himachal Pradesh (Hindustani:  (About this sound listen); literally "snow-laden province") is a state in northern part of India. Situated in the Western Himalayas, it is bordered by states of Jammu and Kashmir on the north, Punjab on the west, Haryana on the southwest, Uttarakhand on the southeast, and Tibet on the east. At its southernmost point, it also touches the state of Uttar Pradesh. The state's name was coined from the Sanskrit?Him means 'snow' and achal means 'land' or 'abode'?by acharya Diwakar Datt Sharma, one of the state's eminent Sanskrit scholars.[9]

The state is spread across valleys. About 90% of the state's population lives in rural areas. Many perennial rivers flow in the state with numerous hydropower plants producing surplus electricity that is sold to other states, such as Delhi, Punjab and West Bengal. Tourism and agriculture are also important constituents of the state's economy. The state has one of the highest per-capita incomes among the Indian states and union territories.

The villages have good connectivity with roads and public health centres. Practically all houses have a toilet and 100% hygiene has been achieved in the state.Notable actions by the state government include a ban on polyethylene bags and tobacco products. According to a survey of CMS - India Corruption Study 2017, Himachal Pradesh is India's least corrupt state.
